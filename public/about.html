            One Body is a health-tracking web application that ensures that you are in check with your body. With its health dashboard, One Body gives users the opportunity to see trends in their health. This is extremely important for when one visits their doctor, to make sure that nothing is slipping through the cracks or forgotten. By being more in tune with how one's body is doing every day, it is easier to identify problem areas and see progress as changes are made to address them. One Body is the start of your health-tracking journey, to preserve the one body you have for life.
